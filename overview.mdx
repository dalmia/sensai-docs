Performing tasks is core to learning anything. But simply telling a learner if they are right or wrong is not enough. Someone needs to be there to ask them the right questions and probe them to think deeper. This is what makes a great teacher great. But maintaining the quality is a challenge as you increase your number of learners. Also, you cannot be there at every moment they need help. This is where SensAI comes in.

SensAI is an open-source, AI Teaching Assistant which enables you to multiply your reach while providing high-quality, real-time, personalized support to every learner whenever they need help. On SensAI, every task is a conversation where SensAI probes a learner to think deeper when they are wrong and nudges them in the right direction. You can go beyond text-based, objective tasks by letting learners speak their answers while defining your own scoring criteria to evaluate them on factors like grammar, tone, clarity, brevity, relevance, etc. As a truly valuable teaching assistant, it helps you speed up course creation and identify where each learner needs help.

Our mission is to make quality education accessible to everyone everywhere in the world.
