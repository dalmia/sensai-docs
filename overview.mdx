title: Overview

SensAI is an open-source, AI-powered learning platform (a.k.a. Learning Management System or LMS) for educators to create their own Coursera-style structured courses using AI while serving as a coach that offers real-time, personalized feedback to learners, helping them improve by asking them questions instead of giving away the answers. Educators get access to detailed learning data at the level of each learner along with AI-generated insights (coming soon) to better understand and support their learners.

Our mission is to make quality education accessible to everyone everywhere in the world.
