title: Overview
---

SensAI is an open-source, AI-powered learning platform for educators to create their own Coursera-style courses using AI while serving as a coach that offers `real-time, personalized feedback` to learners, helping them improve by asking them questions instead of giving away the answers. 

Educators get access to detailed learning data at the level of each learner along with AI-generated insights to better understand and support their learners.

Our mission is to make quality education accessible to everyone everywhere in the world.
