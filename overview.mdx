Performing tasks is core to learning anything. But simply telling a learner if they are right or wrong is not enough.

The number of learners you can reach on your own is limited. You cannot be there for every learner every moment they need help.

SensAI is an open-source, AI-first learning platform where you can convert tasks into conversations. Learners are probed on your answers and nudges to think deeper when they are wrong. Our AI coach is available 24/7 to provide real-time, personalized feedback to learners. You can go beyond text-based objective tasks by letting learners speak their answers or write code into a code editor while defining your own scoring criteria to give them a report on factors like grammar, tone, clarity, brevity, relevance, etc.

You get an AI assistant to help you create your own courses and access to learning data at the level of each learner along with AI-generated insights to better understand and support your learners.

Our mission is to make quality education accessible to everyone everywhere in the world.
