Organizations are the top level of the hierarchy in SensAI. All cohorts, courses, tasks, milestones, and tags are created under an organization.

When you sign up for SensAI, you are automatically added to an organization named `Personal Workspace`. This organization is private to you and you are the `Owner` in it.

If you are a member of a team and want to collaborate with your team members, you can create a new organization from your home page. You can add your team members to the organization as admins.

Every organization has its own `Admin Panel` where you can manage the organization's courses, cohorts, tasks, milestones, and tags.

## Create an organization

You can create an organization from your home page. Optionally, you can choose a default color for the organization's logo.

## Add members to an organization

You can add members to an organization from the `Settings` tab in the `Admin Panel`.

Each member is given the role of `admin`. Admins can manage the organization's courses, cohorts, tasks, milestones, and tags.

Once you add a member to an organization, they will be able to see your organization in the list of organizations they are a part of on their home page.
