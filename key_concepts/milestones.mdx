[Tasks](/key_concepts/tasks) are grouped into [Milestones](/key_concepts/milestones) in a [Course](/key_concepts/courses).

You can assign a milestone to a task only after it has been created in the `Milestones` tab in the `Admin Panel`.

Tasks which are not assigned to a milestone are displayed as `Uncategorized` to learners.
