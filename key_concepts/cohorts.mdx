You can manage your cohorts from the `Cohorts` tab in the `Admin Panel`. All [Courses](/key_concepts/courses) are assigned to one or more cohorts.

Learners are added to a cohort by an admin. A cohort can optionally be divided into groups of learners under a mentor. You can read more about groups, mentors and learners in the [Glossary](/glossary#cohort).
