Here is a collection of examples of how SensAI acts as a teaching assistant both for you and the learners.

## For Learners

If the learner is confused, it never gives the answer away. Instead, it asks questions and nudges them in the right direction. If required, it will also teach the underlying concept.

For questions without a single correct answer, SensAI generates a report based on the learner's response following a [Scoring Criteria](/guides/tasks#scoring-criteria) that you define.

For [programming tasks](/guides/tasks#coding), SensAI will provide a code editor where the learner can write their code and see a live preview of the code before submitting it.

## For Educators

Once you are done preparing your questions, you often need to fill a form to create a task on any LMS. With SensAI, you can just describe the task or give a prompt and SensAI will automatically fill the task creation form for you to simply review it.

For objective questions where there is a single correct answer, you can use AI to generate the correct answer if you don't already have it prepared.

Analyses the conversations of each learner across different tasks to identify their strengths and weaknesses to help you give them the right support.

For Python-based coding tasks, you can generate tests which are run every time the learner runs their code.
