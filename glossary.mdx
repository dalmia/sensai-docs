## Course

A course is a collection of tasks, grouped under milestones.

### Task

A task is the smallest unit of work in a course. A task can be either a `Reading Material` or a `Question`.

#### Reading Material

It is a task where learners are supposed to read the content given.

Learn more in the [Reading Material](/teachers/tasks#reading-material) page.

#### Question

It is a task where learners are supposed to answer the given question. Learners receive feedback from the AI for their answers. If their answer is incorrect, the AI gives them feedback that encourages them to think on their own without giving away the correct answer. `Question` tasks can have multiple types of user inputs and AI responses.

**Input types**

- `Text`: learners can only enter text as their response
- `Code`: learners can enter both text and code as their response and learners are given a code editor to write their code in
- `Audio`: learners can record their response using their microphone

**Response types**

- `Chat`: AI coaches the learners to think on their own and provides hints and feedback on their answers
- `Exam`: AI only checks if the the learner's response matches the reference solution without providing any further guidance
- `Report`: AI generates a report on the learner's response based on a scoring criteria set by you

### Milestone

A milestone is a collection of tasks that are grouped together to form a larger unit of work. Milestones are used to organize similar tasks in a course.

### Tag

A tag is a way to add labels to tasks.

## Cohort

Courses are assigned to cohorts. A cohort is a group of learners who are taking the same course at the same time.

### Group

A cohort can be optionally divided into groups. A group is a collection of learners who are assigned the same tasks. Groups are used to organize learners in a cohort. A group can be optionally assigned one or more mentors who are responsible for the group's progress.

### Mentor

A mentor can be optionally assigned to a group. A mentor is responsible for the progress of the learners in their group. On the home page of a mentor, they can choose to toggle between a learner view and a mentor view. In learner view, they see the same view as a learner. In mentor view, they can see the progress of all the learners in their group.

### Learner

A learner is the one who is taking the course. A learner can be assigned to a cohort, a group, and a mentor.

## Organization

Every cohort falls under an organization. An organization is like a workspace. When you sign up for SensAI, you are automatically assigned a Personal Workspace. If you are part of a school/university/organization and would like to collaborate with your team, you can create an organization and add your team members to it.

### Admin

An admin is a user who has access to the admin panel for an organization. An admin can create and manage cohorts, courses, tasks, etc. for that organization.
The owner of an organization is automatically assigned the admin role for that organization. The owner can also add other users to the organization as admins.

### Admin Panel

The admin panel is a dashboard that allows admins to manage the organization. The admin panel is accessible to admins only. The admin panel is accessible from the sidebar in the web app.

## Gamification

### Streak

A learner is said to have a streak of N days if they have attempted at least one task for each of the last N days. The streak is shown to learners on the home page of their cohort. Streaks are maintained separately for each cohort.

### Leaderboard

The leaderboard is a list of learners who have the highest streaks and the number of tasks completed. The leaderboard is shown to learners on the home page of their cohort. The leaderboard is maintained separately for each cohort.

### Badge

As learners complete tasks, they earn badges. Badges are used to recognize learners for their achievements. Currently, badges are awarded on the basis of streaks. When a learner achieves a higher streak than their previous streak, they are awarded a badge. Learners can see the badges they have earned on their profile page.
