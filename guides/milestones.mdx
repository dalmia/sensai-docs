[Tasks](/guides/tasks) are grouped into [Milestones](/guides/milestones) in a [Course](/guides/courses).

You can assign a task to a milestone only after it has been created in the `Milestones` tab in the `Admin Panel`.

Tasks which are not assigned to a milestone are displayed as `Uncategorized` to learners.
